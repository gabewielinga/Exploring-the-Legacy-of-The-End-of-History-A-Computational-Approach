Research Log: Hitparank
Objective: Doing Hitparank

Steps Taken:
	1.	See whether Xcode Command Line Tools were installed
	◦	They were installed in Library Developer Command Line Tools / usr/ bin / git
	2.  Created N-Gram lists on google sheet using: ‘Ossenkoppele, Thijs. 2023. ‘Creating N-Gram Lists for Paragraph Retrieval with HitPaRank’. https://docs.google.com/document/d/14Xi1Z1SbfWsTE0cIYD8TYYNgQjqh0z1wLYMIqLR7fPY/edit?usp=sharing. ’ 
-> Downloaded them and turned it into TSV file.

Research Log: Installation of cpanm and XML::Twig
Date: December 22, 2024 Researcher: Gabe
I I began the process of setting up the required Perl Modules for my research, follwing the instructions outlined in Thijs Ossenkoppele's guide, "Using HitPaRank for Non-Developers (2023)
One of the modules I needed to install was cpanm, a Perl module managament tool, which is essential for installing additional perl modules such as XML::Twig
1. Initial attempts:
Following the document, I first attemtped to install cpanm via the cpan commanf. The process did not show immediate errors during installation, but after completing the installation, I found that cpanm was still not recognised by the system (-bash: cpanm: command not found)
I tried multipe times to run cpanm Xml::twig but received the same error
Troubleshooting:
To resolve the issues i tried several steps;
Verified whether cpanm was installed correctly by checking the installation directories (/opt/local/libexec/per15/34/sitebin/cpanm) but found it was installed.
Attempted to execute cpanm from its installation path directly, but the command was still not recognised
Further troubleshooting using instmodsh.
I tried to interact with perl modules through instmodsh to check installed modules and find any issues related to cpanm, but this did not provide a solution either.
-> chose to do manual annotation.
