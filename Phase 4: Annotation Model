ANNOTATION MODEL
1	Fukuyama Hard (Teleological, Deterministic): The text presents a view of progress as inevitably leading toward liberal democracy as the final form of governance. It assumes that history follows a singular, irreversible path, and that alternative political systems will ultimately fail or disappear. This view considers liberal democracy as the only universally valid political model.
0	Fukuyama Light (Flexible, Non-Deterministic): The text acknowledges liberal democracy as a dominant or ideal endpoint but allows for setbacks, variations, or the possibility of other systems or trajectories. While it still sees liberal democracy as the best model, it does not present it as the absolute or final state, leaving room for progress or change.
-1	Non-Teleological (Not Teleological): The text rejects a linear or final conception of progress. It does not presume an inevitable or singular endpoint for historical development. Alternative political systems or trajectories are seen as viable, and history is understood as an open-ended process, with no predetermined end state.

Example: “Progress toward European unity has accelerated just when the main prop of the Atlantic partnership, the communist menace, is crumbling. The twelve EC partners are forging a single market; economic and monetary union are slated next; and cooperation on foreign and security policies is intensifying.”
-> Fukuyama Hard (1) 
It has both:
Teleological View: The passage suggests that European unity is an inevitable, linear progression toward a predetermined endpoint, with little recognition of alternative paths or setbacks.
Deterministic Tone: It highlights the accelerating and predictable nature of Europe's transition, reinforcing the idea of a final, inevitable destination for integration.
